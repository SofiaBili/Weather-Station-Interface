# Weather-Station-Interface
This project is the development and design of a Weather Station interface platform. The screen will show the locations of the installed weather stations, the measurements and some information from their sensors.


Specifically the information that will be displayed: 

Information on whether there is smoke, detection of gas leakage, domestic and industrial, detection of LPG, isobutane, propane, methane, alcohol, hydrogen

<h3> Sensors:</h3>

•	MQ-2 

•	MQ-5 

Information on carbon monoxide levels 

<h3> Sensors:</h3>

•	MQ-7

Air quality information - Detection of hazardous gases
(ammonia, aromatic compounds, sulphur, benzene vapour, smoke and other gases)
Sensors:

•	MQ-135

Information on Temperature-Humidity


<h3> Sensors:</h3>

•	DHT22

Ιnformation about the rain

<h3> Sensors:</h3>

•	Rain Sensor 

Information about the dust

<h3> Sensors:</h3>

•	Dust Sensor


The platform will be divided into windows.Once logged in, the user will be taken to the first window which hosts the       points (parts of the installed meteorological stations) giving general information about the weather, If a point is clicked, the user will be taken to a window with more detailed information about the air quality and -if they want they can go to the window related to the energy consumption information of the stations.
